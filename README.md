# DeepQ-Pong
DeepQ Network using Tensorflow to play Pong


Expanding on the Lunar Lander DeepQ network.  I built a pong environment using
OpenAI Gym as a template to better understand reward functions and to tinker with
other aspects of the environment.

Currently supports a Human player as well as dualing agents.
